# First_Bootstrap_Website

This is my bootstrap website that i've build. It is basically a Restaurant Website, with Home Page, About Page and Contact Page. 
I've used bootstrap grid classes to align elements all over the page with HTML5 tags.
You can see that I've used modals too(which is kind off a pop-up) to reserve a table and login.
Here i've also used CSS pre-processors SCSS (Sassy CSS) to style the page.
And the whole project was managed by NPM (node pacakge manager).
